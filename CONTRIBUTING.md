Please remember to tag the issue with the `Question` label so the maintainers can get to your question as soon as possible. If the question is urgent, feel free to reach out to `@PaulEbose` directly in the gophers slack channel.

## How to file a bug report

Bugs are tracked using the Github Issue tracker. When filing a bug, please remember to label the issue as a `Bug` and answer/provide the following:

1. What operating system and terminal are you using?
1. An example that showcases the bug.
1. What did you expect to see?
1. What did you see instead?

## Suggesting an API change

If you have an idea, I'm more than happy to discuss it. Please open an issue and we can work through it. In order to maintain some sense of stability, additions to the top-level API are taken just as seriously as changes that break it. Adding stuff is much easier than removing it.

## Submitting a contribution

In order to maintain stability, most features get fully integrated in more than one PR. This allows for more opportunity to think through each API change without amassing large amounts of tech debt and API changes at once. If your feature can be broken into separate chunks, it will be able to be reviewed much quicker. 

## Writing and running tests
